The maximum tape length, as of now, is defined as a pre-processor macro.
	When it changes the data-type of run_machine:ct, run_machine:i may change
	
The tape symbols are numbers as of now :(

As of now it is considered that the number of tape symbols would determine the tape symbols.
	i.e, if no. is 3 tape symbols are 0, 1 and 2.
	
the blank symbol will be taken as the next unused input symbol
